Imagine you have limited computational capabilities and you wish to delegate tasks. You want to be in a position where only you can access, read and interpret the data. Homomorphic Encryption is a scheme that allows computation on encrypted data. The journey to achieve homomorphic encryption and the progress that has been made to date is presented here. We have both Classical Homomorphic Encryption and Quantum Homomorphic Encryption. In classical both the client and server are classical while in quantum the client is classical and the server is quantum.  Quantum Homomorphic Encryption has several advantages over Classical Homomorphic Encryption like some tasks that are considered to be hard can easily be performed. A vivid description on how both work is explained in the essay.

% At a unviersity like Stellenbosch you *must* produce an abstract in Afrikaans for your masters.
% At AIMS you are encouraged to repeat the abstract in your mother tongue
% French, Igbo, Mlagasy, etc. just write it using LaTeX's special
% characters.
% Arabic students see the arabic.tex file for an example
% Amharic use openoffice and export from there and import a figure here.
% Where the words do not exist put the English work in italics, or use mathematical symbols.
