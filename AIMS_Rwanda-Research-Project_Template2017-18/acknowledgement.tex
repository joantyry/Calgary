The sun rises from the East and sets in the West. This would not be the case if the earth does not orbit around it. Just as the sun, this work has been made possible by different parties. First of all, I would like to thank the Almighty for giving me the strength and courage to finish the project. African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), saw the potential in me, and gave me a platform where I would learn and bring out the best from my potential. I will forever remain grateful for this opportunity. I would also like to pass my special thanks to Barry C Sanders, my supervisor, who  supported me very much in this new area of study. His tireless efforts to explain new concepts and give constant feedbacks cannot go unnoticed. The first time I heard the name tutor I did not actually know what it really means. Today it means sacrifice, continued support and service to the people. This was the meaning given by my tutor Edward. I lack words to express my gratitude to him. Lastly I would like to thank my fellow colleagues and everyone who contributed to my success.
